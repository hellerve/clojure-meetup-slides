# clojure-meetup-slides

The slides I used for the Berlin Clojure Meetup (13th January 2016).
I used [mdp](https://github.com/visit1985/mdp) for the talk. It was
a lot of fun using it.

You can also read my unformed thoughts in the notes.md. It is not
really markdown, though, and pretty far away from what I actually
said.
